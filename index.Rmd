Hello,
I was born and raised in Salt Lake City, UT, spent 2 years living in Uruguay, and graduated from Brigham Young University before moving to Bloomington, IN for my MPA program. I initially started my program to become a policy analyst for family and child welfare policies; accordingly, I have developed qualitative skills for analyzing and suggesting policy changes. My finance, budgeting, accounting, and data analysis classes, however, have been some my favorite classes as I have developed new quantitative skills to use in problem-solving.

This webpage is intended to share some of the quantitative data analysis and visualization skills that I have developed in my program, particularly as they relate to government budgeting. In various tabs at the top, you can view assignments I have completed on forecasting and budgeting.
