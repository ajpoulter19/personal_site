Hello,
I was born and raised in Salt Lake City, UT, spent 2 years living in Uruguay, and graduate from Brigham Young University before moving to Bloomington, IN for my MPA program. I initially started my program to become a policy analyst and have developed qualitative skills for analyzing and suggesting policy changes. My finance, budgeting, accounting, and data analysis classes, however, have been some my favorite classes and I have enjoyed developing quantitative skills in those classes.

This webpage is intended to share some of the quantitative data analysis and visualization skills that I have developed in my program. In various tabs at the top, you can view assignments on forecasting and budgeting.
